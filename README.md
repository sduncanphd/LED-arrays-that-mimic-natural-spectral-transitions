# LED-arrays-that-mimic-natural-spectral-transitions
Most plant biologists use standard growth cabinets that are programmed to switch fluorescent lights on and off at set times. Although these cabinets can effectively generate different day lengths, they cannot recreate natural, gradual light transitions that occur during dawn and dusk. To overcome this, we built a programmable LED array system that can create thousands of light intensity and wavelength ratio combinations. We incorporated it with an existing imaging system specifically to investigate the impact of natural lighting regimes on circadian gene expression. Expensive hardware is required to replicate our circadian experiments, but we relied on a simple LED system to generate the gradual light transitions. This system can be viewed as a frugal stand-alone upgrade suitable for any growth cabinet suitable for anyone wanting to explore the impact of variable light intensities and/or wavelength ratios on plant growth.
